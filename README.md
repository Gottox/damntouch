Damn Touch Interfaces!
======================

I recently tried to work with touchscreens in browsers. I could find any 
library which fits my needs and therefore I started to implement damntouch.



Installation
------------

Just use type

	make

then copy damntouch-jquery.js to your desired location and and include it to your HTML with

	<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/damntouch-jquery.js"></script>
